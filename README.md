CV_Playground
=============

Computer Vision Playground: Miscellaneous odds and ends related to CV.

Most of this sample code was collected from various sources during various CV development projects. It is provided as-is and no support will be provided.


[Chapter8_FaceRecognition](/Chapter8_FaceRecognition)
* Sample from Ch8 of the book "Mastering OpenCV with Practical Computer Vision Projects" ported to OpenCV 3.0 beta. *Note: this crashes my X display as-is.*
* [Additional usefull info on face recognition from the author.](http://www.shervinemami.info/faceRecognition.html)

[camcv](/camcv)
* Face recognition demo for the Raspberry Pi from [here](http://thinkrpi.wordpress.com/2013/06/15/opencvpi-cam-step-7-face-recognition/) 

[curlimage](/curlimage)
* Sample code to download an image via cURL and display it with OpenCV

[facerec_video](/facerec_video)
* Sample code from the face recognition module of OpenCV.

[preparePhoto](preparePhoto)
* Script for preparing a face database for recognition with OpenCV from the blog [here](http://thinkrpi.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/step-5-prepare-photos/). [Original code](http://raufast.org/download/preparePhoto.cpp) *Note: this crashes my X display as-is.*

[preparePhoto3](preparephoto3)
* Hacked up version of the above code. This is what I use to prepare images for my face database to use with [tuFace](https://github.com/rudybrian/tuFace).

[streamtest](streamtest)
* Display an IP webcam stream with OpenCV.

[streamtest-multi-cam](streamtest-multi-cam)
* Multiple camera version of the above.

[ufacedetect](ufacedetect)
* Sample face detection code from OpenCV
